ARM - Development Progress Tracker
Last Updated: February 10, 2026 - 11:30 AM PST
Current Phase: Phase 1 Complete ✅ (P1.1, P1.2, P1.3)

================================================================================
PHASE 1.1: WALKING SKELETON ✅ COMPLETE
================================================================================

Completed: February 10, 2026

What Works:
✅ Convex schema deployed (9 tables: tenants, environments, operators, providers, agentTemplates, agentVersions, agentInstances, changeRecords, + 2 P1.2 placeholders)
✅ Genome hashing with SHA-256 (canonical JSON + Web Crypto API)
✅ Template CRUD (create, list, get, update with change records)
✅ Version CRUD (create, list, get, getLineage, transition)
✅ Instance CRUD (create, list, get, transition, heartbeat)
✅ ChangeRecord queries (list, listByTarget)
✅ Seed script (creates tenant, envs, provider, template, 2 versions, 1 instance)
✅ React UI with Tailwind + ARM dark theme
✅ Sidebar navigation (7 sections)
✅ Directory view with tabs (Templates, Versions, Instances)
✅ Version drawer (genome, hash, lineage, change history)
✅ Integrity verification on version detail reads
✅ Placeholder views for P1.2+ features

Git Commits (7 total):
c1df193 docs: add comprehensive next steps guide with roadmap
04087a0 ui: add version drawer and enhance directory with data display
f9bce08 docs: add implementation completion report
e2ecbba docs: add comprehensive README and quickstart guide
a6abc98 ui: add Tailwind CSS with ARM theme and React foundation
a255469 quarantine: preserve original AR implementation for reference

Files Created:
- 11 Convex files (schema + CRUD + seed)
- 10 UI files (components + views)
- 9 Type files (shared package)
- 8 Documentation files

What's Tested:
✅ Seed script runs without errors
✅ Directory loads and displays data
✅ Version drawer opens and shows details
✅ Tabs switch correctly
✅ Tailwind theme applied

What's NOT Implemented Yet (Deferred to P1.2+):
⬜ Policy evaluation engine
⬜ Approval workflows
⬜ State machine validation guards
⬜ Create template/version forms
⬜ Search and filters
⬜ Authentication enforcement
⬜ RBAC checks

Known Issues:
- None (P1.1 scope complete)

================================================================================
PHASE 1.2: POLICY ENGINE & APPROVALS ✅ COMPLETE
================================================================================

Status: Complete
Start Date: February 10, 2026
End Date: February 10, 2026 (same day!)

Completed:
✅ convex/policyEnvelopes.ts (CRUD with validation)
✅ convex/lib/policyEvaluator.ts (risk classification + autonomy tiers)
✅ ui/src/views/PoliciesView.tsx (full UI with create modal)
✅ convex/approvalRecords.ts (CRUD with operator enrichment)
✅ convex/lib/approvalEngine.ts (workflow logic + state machine validation)
✅ ui/src/views/ApprovalsView.tsx (approval center with filters)
✅ Integration with agentVersions.transition()

What Works:
✅ Policy CRUD (create, list, get, update, delete)
✅ Autonomy tier validation (0-5)
✅ Policy evaluation engine (ALLOW/DENY/NEEDS_APPROVAL)
✅ Risk classification (low/medium/high/critical)
✅ Cost limit enforcement (daily tokens, monthly cost)
✅ Tool whitelist validation
✅ Approval workflows (create, decide, cancel)
✅ State machine validation with guards
✅ Change records for all mutations
✅ Full UI for policies and approvals

================================================================================
PHASE 1.3: ENHANCED UI ✅ COMPLETE
================================================================================

Status: Complete
Start Date: February 10, 2026
End Date: February 10, 2026 (same day!)

Completed:
✅ ui/src/components/StatusChip.tsx (unified status display)
✅ ui/src/components/CopyButton.tsx (clipboard utility)
✅ ui/src/lib/toast.ts + ToastContainer.tsx (notification system)
✅ ui/src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx (global error handler)
✅ ui/src/components/CreateTemplateModal.tsx (template creation)
✅ ui/src/components/CreateVersionModal.tsx (version creation with tool builder)
✅ Enhanced DirectoryView with search and filters
✅ Toast integration in all views (replaced alert())

What Works:
✅ Reusable StatusChip for all status types
✅ Copy-to-clipboard with instant feedback
✅ Toast notifications (success/error/warning/info)
✅ Global error boundary (prevents crashes)
✅ Create template modal with email validation
✅ Create version modal with semver + SHA-256 validation
✅ Dynamic tool manifest builder (add/remove tools)
✅ Search across templates, versions, instances
✅ Status filters for versions and instances
✅ All UI patterns standardized

NEXT SESSION CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Before Starting:
[ ] Read this file (progress.txt)
[ ] Read CLAUDE.md for rules
[ ] Check git status
[ ] Review IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for next step

First Actions:
[ ] Run: npx convex dev (initialize Convex project)
[ ] Update .env.local with Convex URL
[ ] Run: npx convex run seedARM
[ ] Run: cd ui && pnpm install && pnpm dev
[ ] Verify: http://localhost:5173 loads

Then:
[ ] Start P1.2 Step 2.1 (Policy CRUD)
[ ] Update progress.txt after completing step

NOTES & LEARNINGS
================================================================================

Architecture Decisions:
- Convex chosen over FastAPI for faster iteration
- Providers table added to P1.1 (not deferred) for federation readiness
- Hash verification only on detail reads (performance)
- Change records use typed taxonomy (12 explicit events)
- Immutability enforced by absence of mutation (no update path exists)

Patterns That Work:
- Documentation-first approach prevents scope drift
- Small, atomic commits make history readable
- Semantic Tailwind tokens enable easy theme changes
- Convex real-time queries eliminate polling

Patterns to Avoid:
- Don't add dependencies without checking TECH_STACK.md
- Don't skip change records (audit trail breaks)
- Don't mutate genome (creates new version instead)
- Don't verify hashes on list queries (performance killer)
