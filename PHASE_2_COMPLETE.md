### 2. Code Examples

Every API endpoint includes:
- Request format
- Response format
- Success example
- Error handling example

### 3. Diagrams

Complex concepts visualized with:
- System architecture diagrams
- Entity relationship diagrams
- State machine diagrams
- Decision flow diagrams

### 4. Cross-References

Documents link to each other:
- API_REFERENCE → ARCHITECTURE (for design decisions)
- DEPLOYMENT → API_REFERENCE (for endpoints)
- TESTING → API_REFERENCE (for test examples)
- SECURITY → DEPLOYMENT (for production checklist)

### 5. Versioning

All documents include:
- Last updated date
- Version number
- Maintainer information

---

## 🚦 Next Steps
